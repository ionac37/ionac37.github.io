I previously posted on piazza about this as seen here: https://piazza.com/class/ktsjvmqcjf41i6?cid=30.

I have used this software in the past as ann alternitve too lucid chart. It is very much similar to lucid chart and offers
a very good UML toolkit and enables you start making UML documents in a few clicks. One benifit it has over Lucidchart is that
its example diagrams are a lot more indepth.

The main benifit that I found to using it is that it does not have a limit on the number of object that you can have in one diagarm this is something
that I have had problems with when I use lucid chart for more complicated UML and ER diagrams.

I ended up making notes for this exam using Draw.io because of the limitations lucid chart emposes on object numbers. I have attached a screenshot of the notes for C.png.
