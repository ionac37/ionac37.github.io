At the VideoCall end of the association with Participant, you need multiplicity 0..1, because the question said that a participant could be in at most one video call.

Really you should name the association (or alternatively the association ends).

Note that context Participant inv: is not quite right: this whole state diagram is in the context of Participant (so you can assume that), and you are not defining an invariant of the class which is what inv: means.

Since the whole diagram is about a particular Participant, when you want to talk about a VideoCall you have to specify which one.
