This is draw.io (https://app.diagrams.net/) which I used before to do the coursework for Year 2 SEPP. I have attached a png file of the UML class diagram that I have drawn using draw.io. I prefer LucidChart than draw.io because it is hard to add attribute in draw.io. It cannot produce a class with attribute and operation row which allows me to add new attributes and operations. Besides, it is hard to drag the whole contain because the object is not merged together into a single object. I will need to merge them before I drag and then unmerge them in order to add the attributes and operations. It is so frustrating when drawing using draw.io. Other than that, it has a better properties than LucidChart because it can type "-" in attribute which LucidChart will automatically transformed it to the dot and I can figure out how to change the automatic setting. Overall, I still prefer LucidCharts among all the tools I used before.
