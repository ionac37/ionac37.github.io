At the VideoCall end of the association with Participant, you need multiplicity 0..1, because the question said that a participant could be in at most one video call.

Show the object creation as usual with a <<create>> message to a new lifeline, that starts at the point of creation.

You were told not to add things you didn't need, so you should not add a new attribute to represent whether the participant is in a call: that is already there in the property that is the association end connecting Participant to VideoCall in your class diagram.

Note that context Participant inv: is not quite right: this whole state diagram is in the context of Participant (so you can assume that), and you are not defining an invariant of the class which is what inv: means.
