Note that context Participant inv: is not quite right: this whole state diagram is in the context of Participant (so you can assume that), and you are not defining an invariant of the class which is what inv: means.

Since the whole diagram is about a particular Participant, when you want to talk about a VideoCall you have to specify which one.

Good attempt at the OCL even though it isn't quite right!
