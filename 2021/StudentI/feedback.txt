You need a Generalization, shown with an unfilled triangle head, between ZoomCall, TeamsCall and VideoCall.

Really you should name the association (or alternatively the association ends).

A2: 1

Missing types in lifelines: you need e.g. p1:Participant

Use ordinary rectangular instances unless told otherwise - the robustness diagram symbols are not standard in UML.

Show the object creation as usual with a <<create>> message to a new lifeline, that starts at the point of creation.

It is the scheduler, not the call, that has to send messages to the participants.

Use the join method that you already know about from A1.

Don't forget the argument to join: you must pass the very same ZoomCall object that you just created.

Good

OCL: an attempt, but not close enough to correct for marks I'm afraid.

Using oclIsInState is a bit circular! What we're trying to do here is "defining the state in terms of the object's properties".
