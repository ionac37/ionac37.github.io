You need a Generalization between ZoomCall, TeamsCall and VideoCall.

At the VideoCall end of the association with Participant, you need multiplicity 0..1, because the question said that a participant could be in at most one video call.

The instance of scheduler was supposed to be an actor, so show it as such with a stick figure.

Show the object creation as usual with a <<create>> message to a new lifeline, that starts at the point of creation.

Use the join method that you already know about from A1.


B1: 2

You were told not to add things you didn't need, so you should not add a new attribute to represent whether the participant is in a call: that is already there in the property that is the association end connecting Participant to VideoCall in your class diagram.

The state diagram is for Participant, so the call events in it are methods of Participant, not VideoCall.

B2: 0

Note that context Participant inv: is not quite right: this whole state diagram is in the context of Participant (so you can assume that), and you are not defining an invariant of the class which is what inv: means.

Guard: not done
