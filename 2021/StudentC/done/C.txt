I found Visual Paradigm as an alternative for class diagram editing,
however comparing it with LucidChart I found the navigability and ease of use more difficult and clunky.
I believe that  in order for a tool to be effective for me the UI should
be simple to use and have clarity in order to reduce time for learning.
