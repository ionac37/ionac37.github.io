At the VideoCall end of the association with Participant, you need multiplicity 0..1, because the question said that a participant could be in at most one video call.

It is arguable, but I don't think an aggregation between Participant and VideoCall is really appropriate. A Participant is not really a *part* of a VideoCall, even though we use the phrase "to take part in".

Label the creation message <<create>> - see solution video.

You've invented the connect message, though it's quite a reasonable thing to invent.

Correct but can be done a little more simply, see solution video.

NB the videoCall property of Participant already exists - so don't invent a new one!

B2: 2

Note that context Participant inv: is not quite right: this whole state diagram is in the context of Participant (so you can assume that), and you are not defining an invariant of the class which is what inv: means.
