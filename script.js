Only add things you need in order to answer this question. \n1. In LucidChart, draw a nested state diagram for class Participant indicating that a participant can be in a call or not, and that if they are in a call, they may be muted or not. Make the mute setting “sticky” in the sense that if the participant leaves and then joins, they will be muted if and only if they were muted when they left. A newly-created Participant should not be on a call. The default state on entering a call for the first time should be muted. \nInclude events on transitions, but do not include actions.\n\n',

        question: 'This multi-part question produces a single LucidChart diagram. \nNote: you will probably need to enrich the sets of attributes and operations of the Participant class slightly. Do not modify the class diagram you drew earlier. Instead, include in your diagram (e.g. as a Note, a UML comment) a list of any extra attributes and operations you need to add. Only add things you need in order to answer this question. \n2. In the same diagram, add: \n(a) An OCL constraint, placed in an appropriate state of your diagram, describing what it means that the participant is not in a call. (That is, defining the state in terms of the object’s properties.) \n(b) An OCL guard on the transition corresponding to the participant unmuting, to indicate that they can only do this if no other participant on the same call is unmuted. \nYour constraints may use any relevant properties from your Part A class diagram; if you need to use extra properties, make sure they are included in the Note mentioned above.\n\n',
